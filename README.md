Fair and stable launch:

Initially the block rewards for the first 30 blocks contain no coins, this is to ensure that the launch is as fair as possible. This means that pools have time to confirm that their systems are working as expected and that everyone has a fair chance to unlock their wallets and set up solo mining if they wish.

Reward Schedule:

After the initial 30 blocks the reward schedule for this coin features a rapid distribution of coins for the first 28 days. Large rewards are available for those mining on the first and last day of the initial phase to both reward early adopters and also to draw interest to those who may have missed out at the release.

Technical details:

The fundament for this coin is the robust framework of Darkcoin, a proven design which grants our coin a good resistance against double spend attacks and ASIC resistance, as well as helping the miners save power thanks to the X11 algorithm.

In its core, X-Children is a cryptocurrency that aims to motivate miners, as well as traders to invest in it, to eventually work towards the good cause, to help the charities in Gaza through the “Proof of Heart” (massive mining fee reserved for the charity airdrop is at pool operators discretion)

Our pool will have a fixed percentage (40%), reserved for the public address used to stack the Airdrop coins (30%) and the pool operation costs (10%).

Once this goal is fulfilled, and the donation is public and confirmed, the coin will continue being mineable, and new objectives can be set in the near future, whenever the need for compassion and love is needed.
